# Dota 2 Unplayed Heroes

Lists all the heroes that you haven't played yet in your browser. Main audience is new people to Dota 2 like myself, experienced players have of course most likely played all the heroes at least once.

## How to use

You need a Steam dev api key in order to use this application. Put your key in the places where they go in the file main.js.

Also, so far this application only works with my data (I have only two pages of results when it comes to match history). If it works for you too, consider yourself lucky.

## To-do-list

A ton of work left to do, all the way from graphical design to application logic. Just wanted to upload the skeleton already to the GitHub.
